# Sorting-Visualizer
This project is an interactive web-based sorting algorithm visualizer that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool allows users to visualize and better understand how various algorithms sort data step by step.

Key Features:

Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports various common sorting algorithms, such as:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Dynamic Array Generation: Users can generate random arrays of different sizes to visualize sorting on different datasets. This feature allows them to observe how the algorithms handle arrays of varying lengths and values.

Real-Time Sorting Visualization: As the sorting algorithms run, the visualization updates in real-time, showing bars representing array elements. These bars change positions and colors to represent comparisons and swaps, making it easy to follow the algorithmâ€™s process.

Adjustable Speed Control: Users can control the speed of the visualizer, making it faster or slower based on their preferences. This helps users who want to either quickly see the overall process or slowly study each step.

User Interface: The interface includes controls to:

Select different sorting algorithms.

Adjust the array size and sorting speed.

Start, pause, or reset the visualization.

Technical Stack:

HTML: Provides the structure of the visualizer, including the array display, control buttons, and layout for the sorting options.

CSS: Styles the interface, making the visualization visually appealing with vibrant colors representing comparisons and swaps. CSS also ensures responsiveness, adapting the visualizer to different screen sizes.

JavaScript: Manages the core logic behind sorting algorithms. JavaScript functions implement each sorting algorithm, update the visualization in real-time, and handle user interactions. The use of asynchronous JavaScript (setTimeout or async/await) ensures smooth animations during the sorting process.

Project Objectives:

To visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work.

To provide an interactive learning tool for understanding algorithm behavior.

To practice implementing classic sorting algorithms in JavaScript.

To create a dynamic, user-friendly web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This sorting visualizer project is perfect for anyone learning sorting algorithms and provides an engaging and interactive way to see them in action. It also helps develop strong skills in DOM manipulation, animations, and algorithm optimization.
